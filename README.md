Subject: Follow-up on CR ch82365 - Backup Error

Hi Dinesh,

This email is regarding CR ch82365, where you mentioned encountering the following error: "dkhfkdhaf" while taking a backup.

From my analysis, it seems that your user account might not have the necessary permissions for the specified path. Notably, the previous UAT deployment was completed using the HTTP user, which suggests a potential permissions gap for your user account.

To resolve this, I recommend checking with your teammates or the SME team to confirm and obtain the required permissions for the mentioned path. Additionally, you may also need permissions for the current path to proceed with the backup.

For reference, Iâ€™ve included details about CR ch94875, which you handled on the same server but for a different path. This might provide more context and help guide the next steps.

Let me know if you need further assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
